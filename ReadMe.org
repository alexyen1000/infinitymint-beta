** üóø Requirements

+ Mac OSX (any version), Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, 11), Debian (5+), Ubuntu (14+)
+ Node 18.5.0 or Higher

** üóø Installation

First, run =npm install --build-from-source= in the root of the repository.
If you are not using the /InfinityChain/, then you will first need to start /ganache/.
To do this, enter a =GANACHE_URL= within your =.env=.

*** ‚õîÔ∏è OpenSSL Legacy Provider

You might encounter an error regarding ESVP being unspported on your machine.
To solve this, simply run the following in a terminal before you run nom start.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider=
#+END_SRC

*** ‚õîÔ∏è NODE_OPTIONS: --openssl-legacy-provider is invalid

You might encounter this error if you are trying to run infinitymint at a lower version than node 18.15.0.
To fix this, simply heaad to the =.env= file in this repository and remove the =NODE_OPTIONS= line.

*** üóø Getting Started

By default, /InfinityMint/ will be ready to go.
You can use your arrow keys to navigate the menus and you can press enter to select an option.
The default project will be set to /partytime/, a slightly complex InfinityMint project which shows off many of the features of the minter.
You can deploy it via the =deploy_project= button.

**** TODO Update users on the new IM UI.

When you first deploy, InfinityMint will ask for a /export/ location.
This is going to be either infinitymint or infinitymint-classic depending on what you cloned earlier in the installation phase.

An /export/ is simply a website or location InfinityMint will export assets and smart contract ABIs,
& can be configured to the projects demands.

The projects which are used by InfinityMint are stored in a a folder called /projects/ located in the repository.
