# Notes

-   InfinityLinks need to be only key based, removing index
-   Flags/Options inside of the token need to be initialized with default values so we know what is inside
-   External infinity mint users which are working on gems get @ appended to their gems inside of the /gems/ folder to allow for updates. They can also just
    copy their gems over if they like as well.
-   Gems managed by git, fetch remotely the raw file for the gem and check if version is different to one in cache
